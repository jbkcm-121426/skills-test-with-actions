I'll create a comprehensive 5-slide presentation deck for transforming from Hitachi JP1 to cloud-native enterprise scheduling on Azure.

I've created a comprehensive 5-slide presentation deck for transforming from Hitachi JP1 to cloud-native Azure services. Here's what each slide covers:

## Slide Overview:

**Slide 1: Current Challenges & Drivers**
- Technical challenges (infrastructure overhead, scalability, integration complexity)
- Business impacts (high TCO, slow deployment, risk exposure)
- Strategic drivers with quantified targets (40-60% cost reduction, 10x faster deployment)

**Slide 2: Cloud-Native Architecture Blueprint**
- **Orchestration**: Azure Logic Apps + Azure Data Factory
- **Compute**: Azure Functions + Container Apps (serverless)
- **Integration**: Azure API Management + Service Bus (replacing FTP/EDI point-to-point)
- **Observability**: Azure Monitor + Application Insights
- Specific migration paths for FTP → Blob Storage and EDI → Logic Apps

**Slide 3: Phased Migration Strategy**
- **Phase 1** (3 months): Foundation and pilot
- **Phase 2** (4 months): Integration modernization with parallel runs
- **Phase 3** (5 months): Core workload migration
- **Phase 4** (3 months): Optimization and JP1 decommission

**Slide 4: Risk Mitigation & Success Factors**
- Key risks with specific mitigation strategies
- Critical success factors including executive sponsorship, cross-functional teams, and automated testing
- Recommendation for discovery workshop

**Slide 5: Business Case & Expected Outcomes**
- Financial metrics: 45-60% cost reduction, ROI in 12-18 months
- Investment breakdown: $730K-1.15M one-time costs vs $500K-730K annual savings
- Strategic benefits: agility, security, scalability, global reach

The presentation is interactive and ready to present to Japanese stakeholders. Would you like me to adjust any specific aspect or add more detail to any section?
